Lab for our more advanced course algorithm and datastructure course from 2nd year. Programmed in pairs togehter with [Elias Gränse](https://github.com/eliasgranse)

We have inmplemented:
1. Stable Marriage (Gale–Shapley)
2. BFS (Breadth first search)
3. MST (Minimal Spanning tree, Prim's Algorithm)
4. Divide and Conquer (Closest Pair)
5. Dynamical Programming (String alignment)
6. Network flow optimization (Ford-Fulkerson with BFS, Edmond's Karp)

# EDAF05-labs
Labs for EDAF05, held at LTH during study period 4 2018-19. Lecturer and course convenor is Jonas Skeppstedt. Lab assignments are written and maintained by Lars Åström. Previous versions have been written by Thore Husfeldt and Måns Magnusson, lots of credit is given to them regarding the labs! [github](https://github.com/LarsAstrom/EDAF05-labs-public/issues).   

## How to run our labs-files:
5. Clone the project and compile the code. Run the bash-script in the terminal:
    - Write the following command: 
        - `bash check_solution.sh java [MainClassName]`
    - where solution.py / solution is the solution file. ./a.out is the compiled file of a C or C++ solution. If your solution is in Java, it has to be compiled first, and the main class file has to be placed in the folder directory.
